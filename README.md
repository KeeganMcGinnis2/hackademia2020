## Spacebook

As humanity populates the Solar System, people communicating from planet to planet will probably want to send and recieve messages in real-time! Unfortunately, instantaneous communication is impossible given the limits of light travelling in a vaccuum... Spacebook is a messaging service that allows users to connect to chat lobbies from a specified planet and experience the delays brought on by inter-planetary communication!
